# Solutions to the exercises of *Elements of Statistical Learning* (Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman)

This repo contains work-in-progress solutions to the exercises of
[Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) by

The LaTeX document `/notes/Tibt.pdf` contains the solutions provided so far, and is accompanied
by Jupyter notebooks for those exercises that require code (`/notebooks/`).

Exercises solved so far (*italics* for exercises over which I have doubts, **bold** for
those that are accompanied by a notebook):

- Chapter 2: complete - *2*, *7*
- Chapter 3: 1--28 - **2**, *4*, ***17***
