Without loss of generality, the matrix $W$ can be assumed to be symmetric. As long
as its eigenvalues are all zero, its square root is well-defined together with
its inverse. Hence, using the change of variable $a \equiv W^{-1/2} b$:
\begin{equation*}
\max_{\substack{a^T W a = 1}} \, a^T B\, a = \max_{\substack{||b||^2 = 1}}
    \, b^T \tilde{B}\, b, \quad \tilde{B} \equiv W^{-1/2} B W^{-1/2}
\end{equation*}
