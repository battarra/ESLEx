\exercise{2.4}

The components $(X_j)_{j=1,\ldots,p}$ of $X$ are i.i.d. centered and unit variance 
gaussians. Hence, the linear combination $Z \equiv a^T X$ is still gaussian and 
centered, and its variance is also one:
\begin{eqnarray}
\textrm{Var}\left(\sum_{j=1}^p a_j X_j \right) = \sum_{j=1}^p a_j^2 = 1
\end{eqnarray}
