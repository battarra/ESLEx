\exercise{3.10}

In Exercise 3.1, we established that the $F$-score for dropping a single predictor equals the square
of the corresponding $z$-score. Since the $F$ score is proportional to the increase in residual-sum-of 
squares when the predictor is dropped, we see that the predictor with smallest absolute $z$-score is be the one to be dropped.
